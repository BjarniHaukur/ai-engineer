**Abstract Research Problem:**

Enhance the representational capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by integrating Capsule Networks to better capture hierarchical spatial relationships and improve image classification performance.

**Theoretical Foundations:**

Traditional CNNs rely on pooling operations, which can lose important spatial hierarchies between features. Capsule Networks, introduced by Sabour et al. (2017), address this limitation by using groups of neurons called capsules. Each capsule outputs a vector (or tensor) that represents the instantiation parameters of a specific feature. Capsules use dynamic routing mechanisms to preserve the hierarchical pose relationships between parts and wholes.

Mathematically, the output of a capsule is a vector **u**, and the probability of a feature's presence is represented by the vector's length (‖**u**‖). Dynamic routing adjusts the coupling coefficients **cᵢⱼ** between capsules in layer *i* and layer *j* to ensure that lower-level capsules send their outputs to appropriate higher-level capsules.

**Proposed Model Architecture:**

- **Convolutional Base:** Retain the initial convolutional layers to extract low-level features from input images.
- **Primary Capsules Layer:** Replace the final convolutional layer with a Primary Capsules layer, which converts feature maps into capsules. Each capsule represents various properties of features such as pose, texture, and deformation.
- **Class Capsules Layer:** Add a Class Capsules layer on top of the Primary Capsules. Each capsule in this layer corresponds to a class in CIFAR-100 and captures the probability and instantiation parameters of that class being present in the image.
- **Dynamic Routing Mechanism:** Implement the dynamic routing algorithm between the Primary and Class Capsules layers to iteratively refine the coupling coefficients based on the agreement between lower and higher-level capsules.

**Training Process:**

- **Loss Function Formulation:** Utilize the margin loss for classification:

  L<sub>k</sub> = T<sub>k</sub> * max(0, m<sup>+</sup> - ‖**v<sub>k</sub>‖‖)<sup>2</sup> + λ * (1 - T<sub>k</sub>) * max(0, ‖**v<sub>k</sub>‖‖ - m<sup>-</sup>)<sup>2</sup>

  where T<sub>k</sub> = 1 if class *k* is present, m<sup>+</sup> and m<sup>-</sup> are margins, and λ is a down-weighting parameter.

- **Reconstruction Regularization:** Add a decoder network that reconstructs the input image from the output of the Class Capsules. Include the Mean Squared Error (MSE) reconstruction loss weighted by a factor β to encourage the capsules to encode detailed information.

- **Optimization Techniques and Learning Rate Strategies:** Use the Adam optimizer with an appropriate learning rate (e.g., 0.001). Employ learning rate scheduling to adjust the learning rate during training for better convergence.

- **Regularization Methods:** Apply capsule dropout to prevent overfitting. Use data augmentation techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotation to improve generalization.
