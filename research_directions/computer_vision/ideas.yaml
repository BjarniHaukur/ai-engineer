# We can have few shot examples for ideas here, when new ideas are generated, they will be added to this file


- Name: adaptive_receptive_field
  Title: "Adaptive Receptive Field: Dynamic Kernel Size Adjustment for Efficient CNN Training"
  Experiment: >
    Modify the CNN model to dynamically adjust its convolutional kernel sizes during training,
    starting with smaller kernels and gradually increasing them. This could potentially lead
    to faster initial training and better feature extraction at different scales.
  Interestingness: 7
  Feasibility: 5
  Novelty: 6

- Name: layerwise_learning_rates_cnn
  Title: "Layer-wise Learning Rate Adaptation: Optimizing Training Dynamics in Convolutional Neural Networks"
  Experiment: >
    Implement layer-wise learning rates for CNNs, where each convolutional layer has its own
    learning rate. Modify the configure_optimizers function to assign different learning rates
    to different layers, with deeper layers having lower learning rates. Compare the training
    dynamics, convergence speed, and final performance with the baseline CNN model.
