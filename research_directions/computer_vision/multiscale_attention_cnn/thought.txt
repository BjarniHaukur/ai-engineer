**Abstract Research Problem:**
Investigate the impact of integrating multi-scale feature extraction with attention mechanisms in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. The hypothesis is that combining features extracted at multiple scales and using an attention mechanism to weight these features will improve the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and global contexts, leading to enhanced classification performance on datasets like CIFAR-100.

**Theoretical Foundations:**
Multi-scale feature extraction allows the network to analyze images at different levels of detail by using convolutional kernels of varying sizes. Attention mechanisms can dynamically focus on the most relevant features across these scales. Mathematically, let \( x \) be an input image, and \( F_s(x) \) represent the feature maps extracted at scale \( s \). An attention function \( \alpha_s \) assigns a weight to each scale. The combined feature representation \( F(x) \) is:

\[
F(x) = \sum_{s} \alpha_s \cdot F_s(x)
\]

where \( \alpha_s = \text{softmax}(w_s) \) and \( w_s \) are learnable parameters. This formulation allows the network to prioritize features from different scales dynamically.

**Proposed Model Architecture:**
- **Input Layer:** Processes 32x32 RGB images from CIFAR-100.
- **Multi-Scale Convolutional Branches:**
  - **Branch 1:** Uses small kernels (e.g., 3x3) to extract fine-grained features.
  - **Branch 2:** Uses medium kernels (e.g., 5x5) for intermediate features.
  - **Branch 3:** Uses larger kernels (e.g., 7x7) to capture global features.
- **Convolutional Layers in Each Branch:** Each branch consists of a series of convolutional layers, activation functions (e.g., ReLU), and pooling layers to process features at its respective scale.
- **Attention Fusion Module:**
  - Implements an attention mechanism (e.g., a small neural network with a softmax output) that learns weights \( \alpha_s \) for each scale based on the input features.
  - Weights the feature maps from each branch before combining them.
- **Feature Aggregation:**
  - Combines the weighted feature maps from all branches into a single feature representation.
- **Fully Connected Layers:**
  - Processes the aggregated features through one or more dense layers.
- **Output Layer:**
  - Uses a softmax activation function to output class probabilities for the 100 classes.

**Training Process:**
- **Loss Function:**
  - Utilize the categorical cross-entropy loss function appropriate for multi-class classification:
    \[
    \mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log \hat{y}_i
    \]
    where \( y_i \) is the true label and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted probability.
- **Optimization Techniques:**
  - Use an optimizer like Adam, which adapts learning rates for each parameter.
- **Learning Rate Strategies:**
  - Implement learning rate scheduling, such as reducing the learning rate when the validation loss plateaus.
- **Regularization Methods:**
  - Apply dropout after the attention fusion module to prevent overfitting.
  - Use L2 weight decay regularization to penalize large weights.
- **Data Augmentation:**
  - Employ techniques like random cropping, horizontal flipping, and brightness adjustment during training to improve model generalization.

By integrating multi-scale feature extraction with an attention mechanism, the model is expected to better capture diverse patterns within images, improving classification accuracy. This approach leverages existing resources and can be implemented by modifying the current CNN architecture without the need for additional data.
