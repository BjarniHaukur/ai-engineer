    "Thought": "The research problem is to enhance text generation models to produce Shakespearean-style writing that not only mimics the language and themes but also adheres to the poetic structures characteristic of his works, such as iambic pentameter and specific rhyme schemes. The hypothesis is that integrating prosodic constraints into the Transformer model will result in generated text that is more authentically Shakespearean in both form and content.\n\nThe theoretical foundation involves augmenting the standard Transformer architecture to account for metrical patterns and rhyming structures. This can be achieved by introducing additional mechanisms that guide the model towards producing text that follows the desired prosody. Mathematically, this involves defining new loss functions that quantify deviations from the target metrical pattern and rhyme.\n\nThe proposed model architecture retains the core components of the Transformer but includes a Prosody Enforcement Module (PEM). This module interacts with the output layer to adjust token probabilities based on prosodic requirements. Specifically, the PEM calculates the stress pattern of the generated sequence to ensure compliance with iambic pentameter and adjusts token selection to favor words that complete the metrical foot correctly.\n\nThe training process involves optimizing a composite loss function:\n\n\\[ L_{\\text{total}} = L_{\\text{CE}} + \\lambda_1 L_{\\text{meter}} + \\lambda_2 L_{\\text{rhyme}} \\]\n\n- \\( L_{\\text{CE}} \\) is the standard cross-entropy loss between the predicted and target tokens.\n- \\( L_{\\text{meter}} \\) measures the deviation from the iambic pentameter by comparing the stress pattern of the generated line with the ideal pattern.\n- \\( L_{\\text{rhyme}} \\) penalizes the model if the end words of lines do not conform to the desired rhyme scheme.\n- \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) are hyperparameters that balance the influence of each component.\n\nOptimization is performed using the Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling to ensure stable convergence.

    "Thought": "We propose to implement an Adaptive Span Transformer model for enhanced text generation on the Shakespeare dataset. The abstract research problem is to investigate whether dynamically adjusting the attention span for each attention head in the Transformer can improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently while generating high-quality text.\n\nThe theoretical foundation involves modifying the standard self-attention mechanism by introducing learnable attention spans for each head. Mathematically, this requires incorporating a differentiable masking function that limits the attention context based on the adaptive span \\( s_h \\) of each head \\( h \\). The attention weights are computed only over the allowed context window, which varies per head and is updated during training.\n\nThe proposed model architecture retains the Transformer\u2019s layer composition but modifies the multi-head attention mechanism to include adaptive spans. Each attention head \\( h \\) has an associated span parameter \\( s_h \\), which determines the maximum relative position it can attend to. The model learns these spans jointly with other parameters, allowing for a flexible allocation of attention resources.\n\nThe training process involves updating the loss function to include a regularization term that penalizes longer attention spans, promoting computational efficiency. The new loss function is given by:\n\\[\nL = L_{\\text{LM}} + \\lambda \\sum_{h} \\frac{s_h}{S_{\\text{max}}}\n\\]\nwhere \\( L_{\\text{LM}} \\) is the standard language modeling loss (e.g., cross-entropy), \\( s_h \\) is the adaptive span of head \\( h \\), \\( S_{\\text{max}} \\) is the maximum possible span, and \\( \\lambda \\) is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off between performance and efficiency. Optimization will be performed using the Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling, and gradient clipping may be applied for stability. No additional regularization methods are necessary beyond the span penalty term."
