The abstract research problem is to investigate whether incorporating anti-aliasing filters into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can enhance image classification performance by reducing aliasing effects caused by downsampling operations. The hypothesis is that introducing anti-aliasing filters before pooling or strided convolutions will improve the model's shift-invariance and generalization capabilities.

The theoretical foundation is based on signal processing principles, where anti-aliasing filters are used to eliminate high-frequency components before downsampling to prevent aliasing artifacts. In CNNs, downsampling operations like max-pooling and strided convolutions can lead to loss of important spatial information and sensitivity to small input translations. By integrating low-pass filters, we aim to mitigate these issues.

The proposed model architecture modifies the existing CNN by inserting anti-aliasing (low-pass) filters before each downsampling operation. Specifically, we add convolutional layers with fixed or learnable averaging kernels (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) that smooth the feature maps before they are downsampled. This helps preserve important spatial information and reduces the impact of aliasing.

The training process will utilize the standard cross-entropy loss function for classification. Optimization will be performed using stochastic gradient descent with momentum, keeping the same learning rate schedule as the baseline model for fair comparison. Regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout will be applied as in the original model. By training the modified network on CIFAR-100, we will assess whether the inclusion of anti-aliasing filters improves classification accuracy and robustness to input translations compared to the baseline CNN.
