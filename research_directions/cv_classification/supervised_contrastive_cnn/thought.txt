The research problem is to improve the feature representation and classification performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by integrating supervised contrastive learning into the training process. The hypothesis is that combining the traditional cross-entropy loss with a supervised contrastive loss will encourage the model to learn more discriminative features by pulling together representations of samples from the same class and pushing apart those from different classes in the embedding space.

**Theoretical Foundations:**

Supervised contrastive learning builds upon the principles of contrastive learning by utilizing label information to define positive and negative pairs. The supervised contrastive loss \( L_{\text{SCL}} \) for a batch of samples is defined as:

\[
L_{\text{SCL}} = \sum_{i \in I} \frac{1}{|P(i)|} \sum_{p \in P(i)} -\log \frac{\exp(\mathbf{z}_i \cdot \mathbf{z}_p / \tau)}{\sum_{a \in A(i)} \exp(\mathbf{z}_i \cdot \mathbf{z}_a / \tau)}
\]

Where:
- \( I \) is the index set of the batch samples.
- \( P(i) \) is the set of indices of all positives of \( i \) (samples in the same class).
- \( A(i) \) is the set of all indices except \( i \).
- \( \mathbf{z}_i \) is the normalized embedding of sample \( i \).
- \( \tau \) is a temperature scalar that scales the logits.

**Proposed Model Architecture:**

- **Base CNN Encoder:** Use the existing CNN architecture up to the final average pooling layer to extract feature maps from input images.
- **Projection Head:** Add a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection head that maps the extracted features to a lower-dimensional embedding space suitable for contrastive learning. This head consists of one or two fully connected layers with normalization and activation functions.
- **Classifier Head:** Use a separate fully connected layer connected to the base encoder for the classification task.

**Layer Interactions:**

- The base encoder feeds into both the projection head and the classifier head.
- During training, the projection head outputs normalized embeddings for the contrastive loss, while the classifier head outputs logits for the cross-entropy loss.

**Training Process:**

- **Loss Function Formulation:** The total loss \( L_{\text{total}} \) combines the cross-entropy loss \( L_{\text{CE}} \) and the supervised contrastive loss \( L_{\text{SCL}} \):

\[
L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{CE}} + \lambda L_{\text{SCL}}
\]

Where \( \lambda \) is a weighting hyperparameter that balances the two losses.

- **Optimization Techniques:**
  - Use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum for optimization.
  - Implement learning rate scheduling, such as cosine annealing or step decay.
  
- **Regularization Methods:**
  - Apply data augmentation techniques (random cropping, flipping, color jittering) to generate diverse training samples.
  - Use weight decay to regularize the model weights and prevent overfitting.

- **Training Loop Adjustments:**
  - For each batch, compute the embeddings using the projection head and calculate \( L_{\text{SCL}} \) using the embeddings and labels.
  - Compute the classification logits using the classifier head and calculate \( L_{\text{CE}} \).
  - Backpropagate the total loss \( L_{\text{total}} \) to update model parameters.

By integrating supervised contrastive learning, the model is expected to learn better feature representations, which should improve classification accuracy and generalization performance on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The approach has wider significance as it can be applied to other classification tasks and architectures.
