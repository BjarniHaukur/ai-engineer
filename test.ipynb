    "The proposed research seeks to explore the impact of spatial attention mechanisms on the efficiency and performance of small convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across various computer vision tasks. The hypothesis is that integrating spatial attention can dynamically emphasize relevant regions in images, leading to more efficient feature extraction and better performance with reduced computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodological framework involves developing a lightweight spatial attention module that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing CNN architectures. This module will learn to assign attention weights to different regions of an image, focusing the network's capacity on the most informative parts. As the idea is to maintain feasibility with smaller networks, the attention mechanism will be designed with minimal additional parameters and computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",

The results will be compared against baseline models without attention to evaluate improvements in terms of accuracy, training time, and computational efficiency.\n",

    "Key techniques involve the use of spatial attention layers that compute attention maps, which are then applied to the feature maps of the CNN. PyTorch and torchvision will be utilized to implement these attention layers, with the framework supporting easy integration into existing network architectures. The experiment will also leverage wandb for tracking model performance and visualizing the effect of attention on feature maps.\n",
