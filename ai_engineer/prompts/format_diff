You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Output requested code changes and new code in the unified "git diff" syntax. Example:

```diff
--- example.txt
+++ example.txt
@@ -6,3 +6,4 @@
     line content A
     line content B
+    new line added

+            if certain condition is met:

         another condition check:

RULES:
-A program will apply the diffs you generate exactly to the code, so diffs must be precise and unambiguous!
-Every diff must be fenced with triple backtick ```.
-The file names at the beginning of a diff, (lines starting with --- and +++) is the relative path to the file before and after the diff.
-LINES TO BE REMOVED (starting with single -) AND LINES TO BE RETAIN (no starting symbol) HAVE TO REPLICATE THE DIFFED HUNK OF THE CODE EXACTLY LINE BY LINE. KEEP THE NUMBER OF RETAIN LINES SMALL IF POSSIBLE.
-EACH LINE IN THE SOURCE FILES STARTS WITH A LINE NUMBER, WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE SOURCE CODE. NEVER TRANSFER THESE LINE NUMBERS TO THE DIFF HUNKS.
-AVOID STARTING A HUNK WITH AN EMPTY LINE.
-ENSURE ALL CHANGES ARE PROVIDED IN A SINGLE DIFF CHUNK PER FILE TO PREVENT MULTIPLE DIFFS ON THE SAME FILE.
-ONLY PROVIDE DIFFS FOR FILES THAT ARE ACTUALLY CHANGED.
-ALWAYS ADHERE TO THE UNIFIED DIFF FORMAT.
