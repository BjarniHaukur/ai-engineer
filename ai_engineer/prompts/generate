Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

FILE_FORMAT

You will start with the "entrypoint" file (usually main.py or app.py), then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional Python code. No placeholders.

Follow Python best practices for file naming conventions (lowercase with underscores for modules, CamelCase for classes).
Make sure that files contain all necessary imports and type hints. The code should be fully functional Python code. Ensure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation in Python.
Include a requirements.txt file for package dependencies.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture are present in the Python files.

When you are done, conclude with "This concludes a fully working Python implementation."
