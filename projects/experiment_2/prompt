Create a python script for training a classification model on mnist using pytorch lightning.
Use weights and biases to log the progress.
Make sure the architecture description describes the implemented architecture properly. E.g the layers and parameters.

#Init
wandb.init(
    name=run_name,
    project="ai-engineer",
    config={
        "learning_rate": lr,
        "epochs": epochs,
        "architecture_description": architecture_description,
    },
    group="direction_n/idea_n/run_n"
)

#Logging
wandb.log({
    "loss": loss,
    "accuracy": accuracy,
    "epoch": epoch,
})


Put all the code in one runnable python script called main.py
