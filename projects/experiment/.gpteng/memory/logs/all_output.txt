================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Request: Create a python script for training a classification model on mnist using pytorch.
Put all the code in one runnable python script called main.py

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Sure, let's create a Python script for training a classification model on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. We'll include all necessary components such as data loading, model definition, training loop, and evaluation in a single file called `main.py`.

Here's the complete implementation:

main.py
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Define the neural network model
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28 * 28, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 28 * 28)  # Flatten the input
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Function to train the model
def train(model, device, train_loader, optimizer, criterion, epoch):
    model.train()
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        if batch_idx % 100 == 0:
            print(f'Train Epoch: {epoch} [{batch_idx * len(data)}/{len(train_loader.dataset)} '
                  f'({100. * batch_idx / len(train_loader):.0f}%)]\tLoss: {loss.item():.6f}')

# Function to test the model
def test(model, device, test_loader, criterion):
    model.eval()
    test_loss = 0
    correct = 0
    all_preds = []
    all_targets = []
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data, target in test_loader:
            data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
            output = model(data)
            test_loss += criterion(output, target).item()  # Sum up batch loss
            pred = output.argmax(dim=1, keepdim=True)  # Get the index of the max log-probability
            correct += pred.eq(target.view_as(pred)).sum().item()
            all_preds.extend(pred.cpu().numpy())
            all_targets.extend(target.cpu().numpy())

    test_loss /= len(test_loader.dataset)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(all_targets, all_preds)
    print(f'\nTest set: Average loss: {test_loss:.4f}, Accuracy: {correct}/{len(test_loader.dataset)} '
          f'({100. * correct / len(test_loader.dataset):.0f}%)\n')
    print(f'Accuracy Score: {accuracy:.4f}')

def main():
    # Check if CUDA is available
    use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()
    device = torch.device("cuda" if use_cuda else "cpu")

    # Define transformations for the training and testing data
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
    ])

    # Load the MNIST dataset
    train_dataset = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
    test_dataset = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=False, transform=transform)

    # Create data loaders
    train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
    test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=1000, shuffle=False)

    # Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
    model = SimpleNN().to(device)
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())

    # Train and test the model
    for epoch in range(1, 11):
        train(model, device, train_loader, optimizer, criterion, epoch)
        test(model, device, test_loader, criterion)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script does the following:
1. Defines a simple neural network model using PyTorch.
2. Loads the MNIST dataset and applies necessary transformations.
3. Trains the model using the training data.
4. Evaluates the model using the test data.
5. Prints the training loss and test accuracy.

To run this script, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following `requirements.txt` file:

requirements.txt
```
torch
torchvision
scikit-learn
```

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
