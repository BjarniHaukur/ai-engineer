####   
#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Dynamic Depth CNNs: Adaptive Layer Skipping for Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the CNN architecture to include gating mechanisms that allow layers to be conditionally skipped during training and inference. Implement gating functions for each convolutional layer to decide whether to execute the layer based on the input or training phase. Update the forward pass to include these gating decisions, and adjust the loss function to add a penalty for utilizing more layers to encourage efficiency. Compare the model's performance, training time, and computational efficiency against the baseline CNN on the CIFAR-100 dataset. **Abstract Research Problem:**  
#### The hypothesis is that implementing dynamic depth in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by allowing layers to be conditionally skipped can improve training efficiency and potentially enhance generalization performance. By adaptively adjusting the network's depth during training and inference, the model can allocate computational resources more effectively based on the complexity of the input.  
####   
#### **Theoretical Foundations:**  
#### Let \( x \) be the input data, and let the CNN consist of layers \( L_1, L_2, ..., L_n \). Introduce gating functions \( g_i(x; \theta_i) \in \{0, 1\} \) for each layer \( L_i \), where \( \theta_i \) are the parameters of the gating function. The output of layer \( L_i \) is then:  
#### \[ y_i = g_i(x; \theta_i) \cdot L_i(y_{i-1}) + (1 - g_i(x; \theta_i)) \cdot y_{i-1} \]  
#### This formulation allows the network to skip certain layers based on the gating decision.  
####   
#### **Proposed Model Architecture:**  
#### - **Base CNN:** Start with a standard CNN architecture suitable for CIFAR-100, such as ResNet or a custom model.  
#### - **Gating Mechanisms:** For each convolutional layer (or block), add a gating function. This can be a small fully connected network or a simple sigmoid activation that takes the layer's input and outputs a binary decision.  
#### - **Conditional Execution:** Modify the forward pass to include the gating mechanism, so that the output of each layer depends on the gating decision.  
#### - **Skip Connections:** Use residual connections to ensure that skipping a layer does not interrupt the information flow through the network.  
####   
#### **Training Process:**  
#### - **Loss Function:** Combine the standard cross-entropy loss \( \mathcal{L}_{CE} \) with a regularization term \( \mathcal{L}_{Reg} \) that penalizes the use of more layers:  
#### \[ \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{CE} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n g_i(x; \theta_i) \]  
#### where \( \lambda \) is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.  
#### - **Optimization Techniques:** Use standard optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.  
#### - **Learning Rate Strategies:** Implement a learning rate schedule, possibly starting with a higher learning rate and decaying over time. Layer-wise learning rates can also be considered for fine-tuning gating functions.  
#### - **Regularization Methods:** Aside from the layer usage penalty in the loss function, standard regularization techniques like weight decay and dropout can be used.  
#### - **Training Dynamics:** During training, the model learns both the parameters of the convolutional layers and the gating functions. Over time, the network may learn to skip unnecessary layers for certain inputs, improving efficiency.  
####   
#### By integrating dynamic depth into the CNN, the model can adapt its complexity in real-time, potentially leading to faster training and inference times without significant loss in accuracy..  
#### You are given a total of up to 3 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 3.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python main.py'.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS. WRITE THE TRAINING CODE INSIDE main.py  
####   
#### Only implement the code for the Model class.  
####   
#### Use the requirements.txt file to list all the packages required to run the script.  
####   
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

1. **Baseline Model**: Train a standard CNN on CIFAR-100 without any gating mechanisms.
2. **Dynamic Depth Model with Simple Gating**: Implement a simple gating mechanism using a sigmoid function for each layer.
3. **Dynamic Depth Model with Advanced Gating**: Implement a more complex gating mechanism using a small fully connected network.

### Step 1: Implement the Baseline Model

First, we will implement a standard CNN architecture suitable for CIFAR-100. This will serve as our baseline model.

#### Changes to `main.py`

We will define a simple CNN architecture in the `Model` class.

To improve the model, we can try a few modifications:

2. **Add Batch Normalization**: This can help stabilize and accelerate the training process.
3. **Adjust the learning rate**: Sometimes a different learning rate can lead to better performance.

Let's implement these changes.

### Changes:
1. Increase the number of epochs from 3 to 10.
2. Add Batch Normalization after each convolutional layer.
3. Adjust the learning rate to 0.0005.

The error indicates that the Batch Normalization layer is expecting a different number of elements in the running mean than it is receiving. This is likely due to a mismatch in the number of channels between the convolutional layer and the Batch Normalization layer.

Let's correct the order of operations in the forward pass to ensure that the Batch Normalization layers are applied correctly after each corresponding convolutional layer.
