####   
#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Squeeze-and-Excitation CNNs: Enhancing Channel-wise Feature Recalibration for Improved Image Classification.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the CNN architecture to include Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks after certain convolutional layers. Implement the SE blocks by adding functions that perform global average pooling over the feature maps, followed by a bottleneck of fully connected layers with non-linear activation and a sigmoid activation to generate channel-wise weights. Update the forward pass to scale the feature maps by these weights before passing them to the next layer. Train the modified CNN on the CIFAR-100 dataset and compare its performance, convergence speed, and generalization ability against the baseline CNN. Evaluate the impact of SE blocks on model accuracy and ability to capture important channel-wise features. **Abstract Research Problem:**  
####   
#### Explore the integration of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance channel-wise feature recalibration, aiming to improve classification performance on image datasets. The hypothesis is that by modeling channel interdependencies, the network can focus on informative features and achieve better generalization.  
####   
#### **Theoretical Foundations:**  
####   
#### Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) introduce a mechanism to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between channels. Mathematically, given input feature maps \( \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C} \), the SE block applies a squeeze operation using global average pooling to generate channel descriptors \( \mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^{C} \), where:  
####   
#### \[  
#### z_c = \frac{1}{H \times W} \sum_{i=1}^{H} \sum_{j=1}^{W} X_{i,j,c}  
#### \]  
####   
#### The excitation operation then passes these descriptors through a bottleneck of fully connected layers with non-linear activations (ReLU and sigmoid) to generate channel-wise weights \( \mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{R}^{C} \):  
####   
#### \[  
#### \mathbf{s} = \sigma( \mathbf{W}_2 \cdot \delta( \mathbf{W}_1 \cdot \mathbf{z} ) )  
#### \]  
####   
#### where \( \delta \) is the ReLU activation function, \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function, and \( \mathbf{W}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{W}_2 \) are the weights of the fully connected layers. The final output is obtained by reweighting the original feature maps:  
####   
#### \[  
#### \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_{:, :, c} = s_c \cdot \mathbf{X}_{:, :, c}  
#### \]  
####   
#### **Proposed Model Architecture:**  
####   
#### Integrate SE blocks into the existing CNN architecture by inserting them after specific convolutional layers. The SE block consists of:  
####   
#### - **Squeeze**: Global Average Pooling layer to condense spatial information into channel descriptors.  
#### - **Excitation**: A bottleneck of two fully connected layers. The first reduces dimensionality by a ratio \( r \) (e.g., \( r=16 \)), and the second restores it back to the number of channels. This captures non-linear channel-wise dependencies.  
#### - **Recalibration**: Channel-wise multiplication of the original feature maps with the learned weights.  
####   
#### The modified architecture enhances the network's ability to model channel interdependencies without requiring significant additional computational resources.  
####   
#### **Training Process:**  
####   
#### - **Loss Function**: Utilize the standard cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.  
#### - **Optimization**: Employ stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum or Adam optimizer. Implement learning rate scheduling techniques, such as reducing the learning rate on plateau or using cosine annealing.  
#### - **Regularization**: Apply weight decay (L2 regularization) and consider dropout in fully connected layers to prevent overfitting.  
#### - **Training Procedure**:  
####   - Initialize the CNN with SE blocks inserted after selected convolutional layers.  
####   - Train the network end-to-end on the CIFAR-100 training set.  
####   - Monitor validation performance to adjust hyperparameters if necessary.  
#### - **Evaluation**: Compare the modified model's performance against the baseline CNN by assessing accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization on the test set..  
#### You are given a total of up to 3 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 3.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python main.py'.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS. WRITE THE TRAINING CODE INSIDE main.py  
####   
#### Only implement the code for the Model class.  
####   
#### Use the requirements.txt file to list all the packages required to run the script.  
####   
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

To implement the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks into the CNN architecture, we will:

1. Define the SE block as a separate class.
2. Integrate the SE block into the Model class.
3. Implement the forward pass to include the SE block after certain convolutional layers.
4. Update the training and validation steps to use the CIFAR-100 dataset.

Let's start by defining the SE block and integrating it into the Model class.

To improve the validation accuracy, we can try a few modifications:

1. **Increase the number of epochs**: Training for more epochs can help the model learn better.
2. **Add more convolutional layers**: Adding more layers can help the model capture more complex features.
3. **Use a learning rate scheduler**: Adjusting the learning rate during training can help the model converge better.

python main.py --out_dir ./output --wandb_project my_project --wandb_name my_experiment --wandb_group my_group
```

#### Run 1 completed. Here are the results:  
#### Validation accuracy: 0.18080000579357147  
####   
#### Decide if you want to try to improve the result.  
#### We will then run the command `python main.py'.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### If you think you can't improve the results, respond with 'ALL_COMPLETED'.  

To improve the validation accuracy, we can try a few modifications:

1. **Increase the number of epochs**: Training for more epochs can help the model learn better.
2. **Add more convolutional layers**: Adding more layers can help the model capture more complex features.
3. **Use a learning rate scheduler**: Adjusting the learning rate during training can help the model converge better.

Let's implement these changes.

        self.se3 = SEBlock(256)

        self.conv4 = nn.Conv2d(256, 512, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.bn4 = nn.BatchNorm2d(512)
        self.se4 = SEBlock(512)

        self.fc = nn.Linear(512, 100)  # CIFAR-100 has 100 classes

        x = self.conv4(x)
        x = self.bn4(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.se4(x)

        x = F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, (1, 1))

main.py
```python

You can now run the command:

```bash
python main.py
```
