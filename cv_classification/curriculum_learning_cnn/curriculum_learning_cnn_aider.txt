####   
#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Curriculum Learning in CNNs: Enhancing Training Dynamics with Difficulty-Based Data Scheduling.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Implement curriculum learning by assigning difficulty scores to the training examples in the CIFAR-100 dataset. Modify the data loader to present data from easy to hard based on these scores. Update the training loop to incorporate a pacing function that determines the rate at which harder examples are introduced. Compare the model's performance, convergence speed, and generalization against the baseline CNN trained with randomly shuffled data. We propose to investigate the impact of curriculum learning on the training dynamics and performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. The hypothesis is that organizing the training data from easy to hard examples can facilitate better feature learning and faster convergence, leading to improved generalization on unseen data.  
####   
#### **Theoretical Foundations:**  
####   
#### Curriculum learning, inspired by the way humans and animals learn, involves training models by gradually increasing the complexity of the training examples. Mathematically, we can represent the training data as a sequence \(\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N\) ordered by a difficulty score \(d(x_i)\), such that \(d(x_i) \leq d(x_j)\) for \(i < j\). The model learns from examples with increasing difficulty, potentially avoiding poor local minima and enhancing generalization.  
####   
#### **Proposed Model Architecture:**  
####   
#### We will utilize a standard CNN architecture suitable for the CIFAR-100 dataset. This may include convolutional layers with ReLU activations, pooling layers, and fully connected layers leading to the final softmax classification layer. The key novelty is not in the architecture but in the training strategy.  
####   
#### **Training Process:**  
####   
#### 1. **Difficulty Score Calculation:** Assign a difficulty score to each training example. This can be computed using a pre-trained model to estimate the error for each example, or heuristics like edge complexity or brightness variance. Formally, define a difficulty function \(d: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), where \(X\) is the set of training images.  
####   
#### 2. **Curriculum Scheduler:** Develop a pacing function \(p(t)\) that controls the introduction of harder examples over training epochs \(t\). Initially, only the easiest examples (lower \(d(x)\)) are used; as training progresses, harder examples are gradually included.  
####   
#### 3. **Data Loader Modification:** Modify the data loader to sort or batch the training data according to the difficulty scores and pacing function. At each epoch, the data loader provides a subset \(S_t\) of the training data where \(S_t = \{x_i \mid d(x_i) \leq D_t\}\) and \(D_t\) increases with \(t\).  
####   
#### 4. **Loss Function:** Use the standard cross-entropy loss:  
#### \[  
#### \mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^{|S_t|} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)  
#### \]  
#### where \(y_i\) is the true label and \(\hat{y}_i\) is the predicted probability distribution.  
####   
#### 5. **Optimization Techniques:** Apply standard optimization algorithms like SGD with momentum or Adam. Learning rate scheduling can be integrated with the pacing function to adjust the learning rate as harder examples are introduced.  
####   
#### 6. **Regularization Methods:** Incorporate regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout to mitigate overfitting. Since the model sees easier examples more frequently initially, regularization helps maintain generalization.  
####   
#### By training the CNN with curriculum learning, we aim to enhance the model's ability to capture fundamental features before moving on to complex patterns, potentially improving both convergence speed and final test accuracy compared to conventional training methods..  
#### You are given a total of up to 3 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 3.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python main.py'.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS. WRITE THE TRAINING CODE INSIDE main.py  
####   
#### Only implement the code for the Model class.  
####   
#### Use the requirements.txt file to list all the packages required to run the script.  
####   
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

1. **Baseline Model**: Train the CNN with randomly shuffled data.
2. **Curriculum Learning Model**: Train the CNN with curriculum learning, introducing harder examples gradually.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Baseline Model**: Implement a standard CNN architecture and train it with randomly shuffled data.
2. **Curriculum Learning Model**: Implement curriculum learning by:
   - Assigning difficulty scores to the training examples.
   - Modifying the data loader to present data from easy to hard based on these scores.
   - Updating the training loop to incorporate a pacing function.

### Implementation for Baseline Model

Let's start by implementing the baseline model in the `Model` class.

#### Model Architecture

We'll use a simple CNN architecture suitable for the CIFAR-100 dataset.

#### Training Process

We'll use the standard training process with randomly shuffled data.

The error indicates that the shape of the tensor being passed to the fully connected layer `fc1` does not match the expected input size. This is likely due to the dimensions of the tensor after the convolutional and pooling layers.

To fix this, we need to adjust the input size of `fc1` to match the output size of the last convolutional layer. Let's update the `Model` class accordingly.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```

This change updates the input size of `fc1` to `128 * 8 * 8`, which matches the output size of the last convolutional layer after the pooling operations.

You can now run the script again using the command:

The error indicates a mismatch between the dimensions of the tensor after the convolutional and pooling layers and the input size of the first fully connected layer (`fc1`). The output size of the last convolutional layer after pooling operations needs to be correctly calculated.

Let's update the input size of `fc1` to match the output size of the last convolutional layer after pooling operations. The correct size should be `256 * 6 * 6` instead of `128 * 6 * 6`.
